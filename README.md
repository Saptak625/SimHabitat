# SimHabitat
SimHabitat is a simple python project to generate Sim Habitat, a type of habitat that models real life and follows rules for how many of the next trophic level is needed to support a member of a higher trophic level. This program is somewhat optimized and allows for the generation of massive maps. Some premade maps can be downloaded in this repository as well.
